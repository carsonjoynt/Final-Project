# Final-Project
Bop it

The game will select a random number between 1 and three. Depending on the Random number, the game will play a different challenge. If Random number = 1 the game does a low beep, if Random number = 2 the game does a medium beep, if Random number = 3 the game does a high beep. After each beep, the user has 3 seconds to press the input that goes with the beep. 
For low beep, the user has to press the right button. For Medium beep, the user has to shake the device and get a total acceleration of at least 20. For high beep, the user has to press the left button.
If the user completes the challenge in time, they will gain a point that shows on the LEDs. If the LEDs fill up, they will change color and fill up again. If the user fails, the game will play a song and blink red until the switch is off.
If the user turns the switch on, the game turns on.
